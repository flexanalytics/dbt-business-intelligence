# dbt - Dimensional Modeling, Semantic Layer, Metrics and Business Intelligence

This dbt project is database agnostic, requires no data sources, and focuses on the following concepts:
1. **Dimensional Modeling** - dbt data transformations that highlight multi-dimensional (star schema) modeling concepts using the Kimball methodology
2. **Semantic Layer** - leverage dbt as a semantic layer to define metrics, dimensions, aggregations, calculations, data relationships, business-friendly names and descriptions, synonyms, formatting and other data catalog attributes
3. **Business Intelligence** - connect Business Intelligence tools to the dbt semantic layer for analysis, focusing on standards for ["Semantic-free" BI](https://towardsdatascience.com/semantic-free-is-the-future-of-business-intelligence-27aae1d11563) integration with dbt that enables BI tools to "speak the same language"

> Tested on both **dbt Core** and **dbt Cloud** versions 1.0+. Database agnostic and has been tested with the **Postgres**, **BigQuery**, **Snowflake**, **SQL Server**, and **Redshift** [adapters](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/available-adapters).

> **dbt 1.3+** - this project requires dbt and dbt_metrics versions 1.3+. If you'd like to try with dbt < 1.3, then use previous releases of this project.

## Create dbt Project

If you're just getting started learning dbt, then you may want to look at Getting Started with [dbt Core](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started-dbt-core) or [dbt Cloud](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/get-started/getting-started/set-up-dbt-cloud)


### Choose a data warehouse

* **BigQuery** - follow the [dbt BigQuery instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/getting-set-up/setting-up-bigquery#operation/get-account-run) to set up a BigQuery account and connect dbt

* **Snowflake** - follow the [dbt Snowflake instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/getting-set-up/setting-up-snowflake) to set up a Snowflake trial account and connect dbt

* **Redshift** - follow the [dbt Redshift instructions](https://docs.getdbt.com/tutorial/getting-set-up/setting-up-redshift) to set up a Redshift trial account and connect dbt. You can use specific [dbt Redshift configurations](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/redshift-configs). Pay special attention to [recommended distribution styles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/t_designating_distribution_styles.html) for dimensional modeling on Redshift.

## BI Standards

BI vendors and dbt projects should follow these standards to "speak the same language" for a semantic-free BI experience. The following sections highlight how these standards should be applied to dbt projects.

### Lineage

Models must use `ref` and `source` for lineage to be accessible

```sql
select
    {{ dbt_utils.surrogate_key(['order_number','order_line_number']) }} order_key,
    *
from {{ ref('stg_order') }}
```

```sql
select distinct
    order_number,
    order_line_number,
    order_date,
    status
from {{ source('salesforce', 'stg_sales_data') }}
```

### Metrics

Metrics can be defined two ways

1. Using the recommended dbt [Metrics](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/metrics) definition

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: quantity
    label: Quantity
    model: ref('fact_sales')
    description: "Sum of quantity sold"
    type: sum
    sql: quantity
    timestamp: date_day
    time_grains: [day, week, month, year]
```

2. Using the `meta` tag

```yaml
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    columns:
      - name: quantity
        meta:
          metrics:
            total_quantity:
              label: 'Total Quantity'
              type: sum # sum, average, count, count_distinct, min, max
              description: "Sum of quantity sold"
```

### Business (Friendly) Names

Metrics allow for a `label` attribute to create business friendly names.

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: quantity
    label: Quantity
```

All models and model columns will need to use the `meta` tag and define a `label` attribute, as such:

```yaml
models:
  - name: dim_customer
    meta:
      label: Customer
    columns:
      - name: customer_name
        meta:
          label: Customer Name
```

### Descriptions

The `description` attribute is standard on models, columns, metrics, etc. and allow for a detailed definition.

```yaml
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    description: "{{ doc('fact_sales') }}" # references docs block

  - name: dim_order
    description: "All your orders here" # standard description
    columns:
      - name: order_date
        description: "Date of the order from {{ var('company_name') }}" # uses a var

```

You can store descriptions in a `markdown` file and reference with `{{ doc('fact_sales') }}`, which references this markdown file:

```markdown
{% docs fact_sales %}

| Metric         | Definition                                       |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| quantity       | Sum of quantity sold                             |
| price          | Average price for an ordered product             |
| sales          | Sum of total sales revenue                       |
| target         | Sum of target sales revenue                      |

{% enddocs %}
```

### Report Dependencies

Report and dashboard dependencies are called [exposures](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/exposures) in dbt. Exposures allow you to bring together all the downstream usage of a model (BI, ML, or the many other tools an organization has).

Exposures can be part of `schema.yml` or managed in separate files (e.g. `exposures.yml`).

> Use the `meta.tool` to define the tool

```yaml
exposures:
  - name: Area Chart (100% Stacked)
    type: analysis
    url: https://cloud.flexitanalytics.com/#analysis/area-stacked-100
    description: ''
    depends_on:
      - ref('dim_order')
      - ref('dim_product')
      - ref('fact_sales')
    owner:
      name: Andrew Taft
      email: some@email.address
    meta:
      tool: flexit
```

### Joins

The preferred method uses dbt’s `relationships` [test](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/building-a-dbt-project/tests), which serves two purposes:
1. Tests referential integrity, ensuring your data is correct
2. Allows BI tools to know relationships to joining entities

Dbt’s `relationships` test works great for well modeled data (e.g. dimensional star schema), but there may be use cases for more complex joins (multi-column, expressions other than equals, etc.). In this case, we can leverage dbt’s meta property. Here’s an example of both ways to handle joins:

```yaml
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      label: Sales Fact
      joins:
        - to: dim_customer
          type: inner #inner, left, right, full; default 'inner'
          join_on:
            - from_field: customer_key
              exp: '=' #optional; default '='; '=','<>'
              to_field: customer_key
    columns:
      - name: customer_key
        tests:
          - relationships: #JOINS the dbt integrity way
              to: ref('dim_customer')
              field: customer_key
```

Another way for tools to derive joins from dbt models is by defining primary and foreign keys. While many columnar databases (e.g. Snowflake) do not enfore referential integrity (primary and foreign keys), they can still be defined so that tools can pick them up. For traditional relational databases, it can be important to define primary and foreign keys for performance reasons as well.

> Important: to use primary and foreign key constraints, set the dbt_project.yml variable "dbt_constraints_enabled: true"

> Note: dbt 1.5+ supports primary_key and foreign_key [constraints](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/constraints). However, as of dbt-core v1.5.2, constraints require [contracts](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-configs/contract) to be enabled. The catch-22 is that contracts then require ALL model columns to define data_type, but data_type is database-specific, so you lose the incredible database agnostic features of dbt. For this reason, we use the [`dbt_constraints`](https://github.com/Snowflake-Labs/dbt_constraints) package to enable cross-database support for primary and foreign keys. The issue will be tracked [here](https://github.com/flexanalytics/dbt-business-intelligence/issues/11).

### Data Freshness

BI tools should use dbt's built in run/job update timestamps and [source freshness](https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/resource-properties/freshness) to display data freshness information to end users.

You can also use dbt [Dashboard Tiles](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/dbt-cloud/using-dbt-cloud/cloud-dashboard-status-tiles) to place freshness “tiles” into dashboards, giving users the ability to see high-level freshness and drill into detail, if necessary.

### Statistics

Information such as `Number of rows` or `Size` of a table/model can be very informative and build trust in the data. If the underlying data source supports these statistics, then dbt makes `stats` available on models and then the BI tool can make them available to end users.

### Synonyms

Synonyms (aliases) allow you to assign multiple potential names to a single column. For example, sales might be called revenue, receipts, proceeds, or other names depending on who you ask. Synonyms can be used for search and Natural Language Query (NLQ).

This is not a build-in dbt feature, so we use the meta tag, as shown here:

```yaml
metrics:
  - name: sales
    label: Sales
    model: ref('fact_sales')
    description: "Sum of total sales revenue"
    type: sum
    sql: sales
    timestamp: date_day
    time_grains: [day, week, month, year]
    meta:
      synonyms: # for business searching and natural language processing
        - Revenue
        - Proceeds
        - Receipts
```

### Formatting

Define column formatting for numbers, dates, currency, and text

```yaml
models:
  - name: monthly_sales
    columns:
      - name: revenue
        meta:
          format:
            type: number
            decimalPlaces: 2
            prefix: "$"
            displayUnits: auto # auto, thousands, millions, billions, trillions
      - name: quantity
        meta:
          format:
            type: number
            suffix: " units sold"
      - name: date_day
        meta:
          format:
            type: date
            pattern: 'MMM D, YYYY'
      - name: mrr_change
        meta:
          format:
            type: percent
            divideBy100: true
      - name: descr
        meta:
          format:
            type: text
            showNullAs: 'No Value Entered'
```

Depending on type, possible attributes are:
* decimalPlaces
* prefix
* suffix
* displayUnits
* showNullAs
* pattern (*date only*)
* divideBy100 (*percent only*)


### Hidden

Use the `meta.hidden` attribute on models, model columns, and metrics to hide it from being displayed to end users in the BI tool.

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: stg_dummy_table
    meta:
      hidden: true
```

### Display Order

Use the `display_index` meta tag to place models and columns in a specific order

```yaml title="models/schema.yml"
models:
  - name: fact_sales
    meta:
      label: Sales Fact
      display_index: 1 # display first
```
